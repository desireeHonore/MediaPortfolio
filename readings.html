Reading & Reflection 1 - September 10, 2025<br>
      My use of photography throughout the years has differed drastically. Being born and raised in the 1990s, photography began as a sacred pastime.<br>
      Something that was held [in high regard?] as highly valuable, bestowing a most precious treasure, memories…just as they were remembered. <br>
      Fast forward to present day, the role photography plays in my life is different, unreliable, untrustworthy to say the least. To be completely transparent, <br>
      my use of photography and image making has been irresponsible, in the sense of totally abandoning the ingenuity and intentionality of photography and image <br>
      making as an art and I hope that will change during the duration of this course.<br><br>
      
Susan Sontag’s, “In Plato’s Cave”, provided a timeless journey throughout space and time. I could correspond with the text considering the dramatic transformation <br>
of photographic consumption today. Specifically, through channels such as social media, mass digital photo storage, and the justified glorification of photographers<br>
and their talent, as well as the physical photograph, something that was widely accessible to all, now becoming increasingly uncommon. <br><br>
      
Through a retrospective lens, I can’t help but feel nostalgically connected to the significance and role the camera, and the photographs it took, especially within in <br>
my own household. It was a vessel of memory, shaping how experiences were recorded and retold, passing down from generation to generation, an heirloom. <br><br>
      
There wasn’t the opportunity to capture “the perfect shot”, but all the photos from the wind-up camera that wouldn’t be revealed until a week or two later were <br>
executed as the perfect shot, worthy of being placed in the accredited photo album (albeit some photos would prove visually indiscernible and wouldn’t make the cut). <br>
Photo albums and the pictures it contained was a necessity and how we stayed connected to the world around us, to our ancestors, our distant relatives and the treasured <br>
moments we made. The culture of photography, theoretically, resonated differently than the memories I create in the present.<br><br>
      
I couldn’t imagine a world without the photographic rituals of the past, a world where I wouldn’t have captured my beloved late aunt when she was most full of like, but <br>
only photos held in my smartphone of her sick and confined to her hospital bed. It presents somewhat of a melancholy reflection.<br><br>
      
I am also reminded of the inherently digital black hole we find ourselves in, where without a backup of our precious timepieces, like your daughter’s first steps, they can <br>
be lost forever (yeah, I learned the hard way). The physicality of photographs may seem less significant these days, but I appreciate Sontag highlighting the profound impact <br>
it’s had on both past and present alike. <br><br>

These considerations inspire me to represent visually photography, illustrations and text notions in a way that captures a feeling of responsibility. Responsibility to the subject,<br> 
the camera and its boundless properties and ensuring that I express the message with the utmost sincerity, so the viewer can truly interpret its meaning. Incorporating that nostalgic <br>
feel to photography and illustration can evoke a sense of longing, serenity and culture.
